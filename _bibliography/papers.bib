    abstract  = {We introduce a unique haptic rendering framework that transforms the performer’s actions into wearable vibrotactile feedback for an immersive virtual reality (VR) performance experience. To capture essential movements from the virtual performer, we propose a method called Motion Salient Triangle. Motion Salient Triangle is a real-time 3D polygon that computes haptic characteristics (intensity, location) based on motion skeletal data. Here, we employ an entire upper-body haptic system that provides vibrotactile feedback on the torso, back, and shoulders. This haptic rendering pipeline enable audiences to experience immersive VR performance by accommodating the performer’s motions on top of motion-to-haptic feedback.},

    abstract  = {We introduce ThumbJoy, which utilizes the physical movement of the left thumb metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint along with its psychophysical qualities as a joystick. Using an inertial measurement unit (IMU), ThumbJoy avoids the restraints of hand tracking occlusion, allowing more contact area for the thumb thus providing self-haptics. We first conducted a pilot study of 20 participants to systematically analyze the characteristics of the MCP joint. Using these results, we implemented an algorithm that converts joint movement to a planar 2D axis movement. We then conducted a user study comparing ThumbJoy with conventional interaction mediums in a virtual reality (VR) environment. Through this, we demonstrate that ThumbJoy can provide an intuitive method of control while increasing immersion and enjoyment in VR along with the use of self-haptics.},
