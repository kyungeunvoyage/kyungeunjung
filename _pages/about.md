Hi:raised_hands: This is Kyungeun Jung, a Master's student in [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr).
I'm now part of [HCI Tech Lab](https://hcitech.org/#), advised by professor Sang Ho Yoon.

I'm interested in HCI, especially in Haptics interfaces regarding human ergonomics!

Please feel free to email me <a href="mailto:ï»¿ kyungeun.jung@kaist.ac.kr">kyungeun.jung@kaist.ac.kr</a> :^) :sparkles:


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
