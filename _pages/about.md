Hi:raised_hands: This is Kyungeun Jung!

I am a first year Ph.D Student at [HCI Tech Lab](https://hcitech.org/#), advised by professor Sang Ho Yoon. My experience spans across the domain of haptics, wearable interfaces.

I continuously seek answers especially in Haptics interfaces regarding human ergonomics! Still creating some meaningful questions and answers, and hope to fulfill my research journey with lots of sparkling and creative ideas.

In my leisure time, I love to explore some sites to walk and enjoy the scenery of [greeny trees ðŸŒ³](https://www.instagram.com/littlesalixbabylonica/).

Please feel free to email me <a href="mailto:ï»¿ kyungeun.jung@kaist.ac.kr">kyungeun.jung@kaist.ac.kr</a> :^) :sparkles:


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
